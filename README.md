# Module 10: Mission to Mars - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS & NoSQL
## Resources

## Challenge Project Overview 

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I created a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings worldwide. To display this data, I created a table to organize UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. This table can filter the data table array using text box search criteria set up using the JS D3 library. JavaScript was the primary coding language to program the webpage using HTML. At the same time, CSS and Bootstrap were used to help style the HTML webpage.
